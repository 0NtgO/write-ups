# Plaid CTF 2014: kpop

**Category:** Web
**Points:** 200
**Description:**

> Sometimes, the Plague leaves some of his old stuff up and running. We found a [K-Pop lyrics website](http://54.234.123.205/) the Plague wrote back when he was learning to program. It was [open-source](kpop-686da11b170e7054ebee30a218d6490f.tar.bz2), too! We believe there might be something important in `/home/flag/flag`. Could you get it for us?
