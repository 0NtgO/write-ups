# Plaid CTF 2014: curlcore

**Category:** Forensics
**Points:** 250
**Description:**

> We managed to grab a [memory dump](curlcore-b9b2bc016a796db9db66be6365d48a6b.tar.bz2) off of The Plague's computer while he was making a secure download. We think he may have been looking for new places to hide the Prime Factorizer. Can you figure out what messages were sent through his computer?
