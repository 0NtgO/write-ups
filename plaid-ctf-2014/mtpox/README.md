**Description:**

> The Plague has traveled back in time to create a cryptocurrency before Satoshi does in an attempt to quickly gain the resources required for his empire. As you step out of your time machine, you learn [his exchange](http://54.211.6.40/) has stopped trades, due to some sort of bug. However, if you could break into the database and show a different story of where the coins went, we might be able to stop The Plague.
