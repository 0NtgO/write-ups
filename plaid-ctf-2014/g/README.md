# Plaid CTF 2014: g++

**Category:** Reversing
**Points:** 200
**Description:**

> Although it seems like The Plague's projects are open source, it's not quite so simple to figure out what the source code does. We believe [this project](g++-30f6a74ce24ea3605ba7cbec92222a72.tar.bz2) is supposed to print out secret information, but the KEY variable in the Makefile has been lost. Find the key, build the project, get us the information.
