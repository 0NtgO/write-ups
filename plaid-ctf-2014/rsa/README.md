# Plaid CTF 2014: rsa

**Category:** Forensics
**Points:** 450
**Description:**

> Our archaeologists recovered a dusty and corrupted old hard drive used by The Plague in his trips into the past. It contains a private key, but this has long since been lost to bitrot. Can you recover the full key from the [little information we have recovered](rsa-6537e9aae493b0c43601d1dbc2da2ce2.tar.bz2)?
