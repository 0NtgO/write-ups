# Plaid CTF 2014: PolygonShifter

**Category:** Web
**Points:** 100
**Description:**

> The Plague has purchased the newest invention, _Polygon Shifter_ to protect his website. This cutting edge technology is made available by Polygon Security, and they have a demo page on their [website](http://54.204.80.192/). They claim bots can no longer attack the website protected by the Polygon Shifter. Do we need to manually bruteforce the credentials?
