# Plaid CTF 2014: zfs

**Category:** Forensics
**Points:** 400
**Description:**

> The Plague is using state of the art systems for storing his data. Our operatives managed to steal [a drive](zfs-ff06f37193caa92456e9c03090c80600.tar.bz2) from one of his servers, but it seems like our haste may have led to some uber-corruption. Can you get the data off the drive to track down The Plague?
